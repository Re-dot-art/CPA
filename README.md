## Rethinking Mean Teacher in Source Free Object Detection from A Prototypes Alignment Perspective
# Contributions
1) we propose class prototypes and introduce them into SFOD;
2) based on the class prototypes, we propose a new SFOD method, called Class Prototypes Alignment (CPA). Prototype contrastive and prototype distillation losses are introduced to improve the model representation ability;
3) extensive experiments are carried out on several experimental setups and compared with the latest methods, our method has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
